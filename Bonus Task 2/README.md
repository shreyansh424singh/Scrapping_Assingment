The program input the minimum and maximum difficulty from the user.

It also inputs the number of problems required by the user.

Then it will create a folder with name "Difficulty level _minDifficulty_ to _maxDifficulty_ "

Inside that folder it will create folder for every problem which will contain screenshot of problem and text files of all sample inputs and outputs.

(I was unable to take screenshot properly. I tried several methods but it only takes screenshot of the part of the problem visible.)
